# üëã Hi, I'm Sai!

## Distributed Systems Storage Engineer | Exabyte-Scale Object Storage

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about building and scaling distributed storage systems that push the boundaries of modern hardware. Currently, I engineer and optimize exabyte-scale object storage platforms‚Äîsolving performance puzzles, scaling for exabytes, and debugging the sort of complex multi-network systems that sometimes keeps me up at night.

### üöÄ What I Do

- **Distributed Systems Algorithms & Database Internals:** Working with consensus (Raft, Paxos), replication, consistency models, and deep dives into storage engines (row store, column store, LSM engines), indexing, and request processing lifecycle.
- **AI & RAG Stacks:** Designing advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems with hybrid semantic search and LLM-compatible agent servers.
- **Framework Development:** Shipping frameworks and developer tools adopted by teams across Apple, AWS, Uber, and more.
- **Performance Tuning:** Squeezing every last drop out of large-scale storage systems. JVM GC analysis, flame graphs, network tracing, etc.
- **Scaling Challenges:** Architecting for growth, from petabytes to exabytes (and beyond).
- **Deep Debugging:** Investigating and resolving gnarly issues in multi-layered, multi-network environments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Toolbox

- **Languages:** Java, Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript, TLA+
- **Storage Systems:** Distributed object storage, high-availability architectures
- **Database Internals & Algorithms:** Storage models (row store, column store, LSM), query optimization, indexing, replication, Raft/Paxos consensus, consistency and fault tolerance
- **AI/ML:** Hybrid semantic search, RAG evaluations, OpenAI-compatible LLMs, agent orchestration

### üåü Featured Projects

- [**i3grid**](https://github.com/justahuman1/i3grid): A dynamic window tiling extension for i3wm, making power-users' lives a little (or a lot) easier. Loved by the i3 community!
- **RAG Stacks & Frameworks:** Deployed complex AI-driven search infra for multiple large-scale deployments.
- **Frameworks @ Apple & AWS:** Engineered robust, high-performance frameworks and developer tools that empower teams across the org.

### ü§π Fun Facts

- Debugging distributed system mysteries and making things run fast are some of my favorite parts of my work
- My code sometimes ends up in places I never expected (hello, random i3 user)
